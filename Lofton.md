# Engineering Notebook: Tyler Lofton

## Sprint 1

During this sprint I worked researching TypeScript since I have never done any work with it before. I created the basic structure of the HTML file and started work on creating getting the context on the canvases and changeing there colors to show I can edit the canvas. Did some minor revisions and work on the teams project proposal.

Struggling to get the canvases to stack properly but can edit each individual canvas.
