# Engineering Notebook: Tyler Lofton

## Sprint 1

During this sprint I worked researching TypeScript since I have never done any work with it before. I created the basic structure of the HTML file and started work on creating getting the context on the canvases and changeing there colors to show I can edit the canvas. Did some minor revisions and work on the teams project proposal.

Struggling to get the canvases to stack properly but can edit each individual canvas.

## Sprint 2

### 10/8/2024

Was able to get the canvases to properly stack still working on the resizing and placement of each individual canvas.

### 10/10/2024

Found out how to resize the individual canvases to place them in a position that makes sense with page we are trying to replicate from the customer.

Struggling to get all canvases to be visible since after a certain point they are not visible.

## Sprint 3

### 10/22/2024

Realized the original way I was trying to create the boxes was really bad and not the way I needed to go about it. I created a new branch that would only use a single canvas and draw everything on that canvas. Was able to recreate all of the original boxes I needed as well as adding text.

I did everything manually so I started to reformat everything in a way that would be easier to add more boxes or other features in the future.
