# Engineering Notebook: Haskell Cappers

## Sprint 1
    - During this sprint I was researching Typescript, Javascript, and working with HTML canvas.
    - This spring I was really struggling on how to work with canvas and get two canvas to stack together. 

## Sprint 2
### 08OCT24
    - Was able to get individual canvases to properly stack
### 10OCT24
    - Gained the ability to change the size of each canvas
    - Still having an issue that after 3 canvases are added the fourth never shows

## Sprint 3
### 23OCT24
    - On this day I got my working branch to have a canvas with added text, and was able to make rings for the contellation graph
### 24OCT24
    - On this day I was able to take the text I made on a canvas and piviot that information over to the new style of just trying the boxes instead of using canvas for each box. I was also able to add the text for the other two screens. 
    - Started to work on the bar graph, right now it is just a rectangle with a grid.
