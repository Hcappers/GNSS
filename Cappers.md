# Engineering Notebook: Haskell Cappers

## Sprint 1
    - During this sprint I was researching Typescript, Javascript, and working with HTML canvas.
    - This spring I was really struggling on how to work with canvas and get two canvas to stack together. 

## Sprint 2
### 08OCT24
    - Was able to get individual canvases to properly stack
### 10OCT24
    - Gained the ability to change the size of each canvas
    - Still having an issue that after 3 canvases are added the fourth never shows

## Sprint 3
### 23OCT24
    - On this day I got my working branch to have a canvas with added text, and was able to make rings for the contellation graph
### 24OCT24
    - On this day I was able to take the text I made on a canvas and piviot that information over to the new style of just trying the boxes instead of using canvas for each box. I was also able to add the text for the other two screens. 
    - Started to work on the bar graph, right now it is just a rectangle with a grid.

## Sprint 4
### 29OCT24
    - Continued working on the window, created functions to create each window and add the each bit of data for it
### 31OCT24
    - Finished the constellation rings, added place holders at the bottom of the gps graph. 
    - I started working on making the typescript file modular. Having an issue getting the file to read into the HTML file
### 01NOV24
    - Continued to work on the typescript modular file. 
    - Started researching how to take what we have and start implementation into Flight Sime 2020
