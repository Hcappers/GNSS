# Engineering Notebook: Haskell Cappers

## Sprint 1
    - During this sprint I was researching Typescript, Javascript, and working with HTML canvas.
    - This spring I was really struggling on how to work with canvas and get two canvas to stack together. 

## Sprint 2
### 08OCT24
    - Was able to get individual canvases to properly stack
### 10OCT24
    - Gained the ability to change the size of each canvas
    - Still having an issue that after 3 canvases are added the fourth never shows

## Sprint 3
### 23OCT24
    - On this day I got my working branch to have a canvas with added text, and was able to make rings for the contellation graph
### 24OCT24
    - On this day I was able to take the text I made on a canvas and piviot that information over to the new style of just trying the boxes instead of using canvas for each box. I was also able to add the text for the other two screens. 
    - Started to work on the bar graph, right now it is just a rectangle with a grid.

## Sprint 4
### 29OCT24
    - Continued working on the window, created functions to create each window and add the each bit of data for it
### 31OCT24
    - Finished the constellation rings, added place holders at the bottom of the gps graph. 
    - I started working on making the typescript file modular. Having an issue getting the file to read into the HTML file
### 01NOV24
    - Continued to work on the typescript modular file. 
    - Started researching how to take what we have and start implementation into Flight Sime 2020

## Sprint 4
### 10/29/2024
    - Started updating code to help for readibleity, started learning how to make the code modular and split all sections of code into their own file 
### 10/31/2024
    - Was able to get all code to run in different files, however when trying to compile the javascript file the code does not run.
    - More research is needed to see why this is an issue. 
### 11/01/2024
    - Fixed some sizing issues with the constelation rings
    - Made some place holder bars under the bar graphs if we decide to use them
### 11/06/2024
    - Merged my branch that I have been working on with main, worked on fixing the code to fit with the current main branch

## Sprint 5
### 11/14/2024
     
### 11/18/2024
    - Downloaded the SDK for MSFS 202. Looking into the documentation to see how the variables will work with the current state of the code. 

    - Started work on the poster. 
### 11/20/2024
### 11/21/2024
    - Had a scheduled meeting with the customer today. The custormer (CARS Lab) like the current design we have for the project
    - Finshed reviewing the the poster 
### 11/25/2024
    - Worked with the team on updating the SRS v2 
    
## Sprint 6
### 11/26/2024
    - Helped with the srpint 6 backlog items
    - contined work on the SRS v2
### 12/2/2024
    - Started working on the Test Plan v1 document.

## Sprint 7
    - This Sprint was used to re-connect with out customer (CARS Lab) and to get a better understanding of what they are wanting for the final product to be. From the conversations we were able to finalize all of out customer requiremtns and get some feedback of the current state of the product. Another item we worked on during this sprint is the final SRS. I have sent Dr. T an email to see if an option could be to make 2 steam accounts and get keys put on them so we can contiune development on our product. I have conituned to look through the SDK so I have some understanding of how to integrate the product. 
## Sptint 8
    - This sprint was heavily focused on the SRS as well as getting some familiarity with MSFS and the SDK. I have been mainly looking through the SDK since we currently only have one key to begin the integration of our product with MSFS2020
## Sprint 9
