# Engineering Notebook: Haskell Cappers

## Sprint 1
    - During this sprint I was researching Typescript, Javascript, and working with HTML canvas.
    - This spring I was really struggling on how to work with canvas and get two canvas to stack together. 

## Sprint 2
    - During this sprint I was able to get 2 canvas to stack and to change the color of the each canvas seperatly.
    - An issue I ran into was that once I got more then two canvas they would not stack any more and just move to random spots on the screen. 

## Sprint 3
### 23OCT24
    - On this day I got my working branch to have a canvas with added text, and was able to make rings for the contellation graph
### 24OCT24
    - On this day I was able to take the text I made on a canvas and piviot that information over to the new style of just trying the boxes instead of using canvas for each box. I was also able to add the text for the other two screens. 
    - Started to work on the bar graph, right now it is just a rectangle with a grid.
