Sprint 1 and Sprint 2
- Researched the proper software to use in order to design the necessary hardware
- Developed a list of components to simulate
- Learned how to use necessary software

Sprint 3 and Sprint 4
- Missed several classes due to a family emergency, no progress.
- 
Sprint 5
- Continued to learn how to do necessary software for hardware creation
- Troubleshooting sample components
- Research on SimConnect
- Devised plan with professor and team to catch up on progress for the next semester
- 
Sprint 6
- Started test case lists for hardware as it interacts with the software component
- Created simple button function in OnShape
- Worked on Test Plan document

Future Plan:
  - In between last sprint and initial sprint of the spring semester, I have the intention and plan of working on the
  - creation of the hardware and having a functional simulation to utilize and continue creation of test cases.
  - I also intend on creating a list of components and communicating with the CARS lab to begin the process of creating the
  - physical hardware.
