# Spring 2025

## Sprint 1

### 01/11/2025
Added some extra requirements under Behavioral Requirements to cover more ground.

### 01/13/2025
Refined the Table of Contents to ensure all page numbers are accurate. Also added MSFS Developer Support as a reference in the project documentation.

### 01/22/2025
Added "System Tester" as a new actor in the project. 

### 01/22/2025
Created a new use case: "Validate System Performance," so the new actor actually has a role.

### 01/22/2025
Dropped a link to MSFS Developer Support in the General Constraints section—good design needs good guidance.

### 01/22/2025
Locked in display size requirements: 800x480 (16:9) and 1024x768 (4:3). No more guesswork on resolutions.

### 01/27/2025
Refined External, User, Hardware, and Software Interface Requirements to align with the hardcoded GPS plugin setup and MSFS SDK integration. Clarified that the User Interface is read-only, displaying pre-defined GPS data with no custom inputs. 

### 01/27/2025
Confirmed that Hardware Interfaces operate independently, without reliance on external hardware. Also updated Software Interfaces to detail how the GPS display integrates with MSFS 2020 SDK.

### 01/27/2025
Confirmed that the plugin doesn’t need external communication to function, everything stays self-contained.

### 01/27/2025
Reviewed the Behavioral Requirements section and made sure it aligns with how the system actually works.

### 01/27/2025
Expanded Section 8 to cover stakeholder communication and the broader societal impact of the GPS plugin.
